As a personal project, I developed an AI-based image classification model to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray scans using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras. The project focused on applying deep learning techniques to a real-world biomedical problem and demonstrates the potential of AI in radiological diagnostics.

ðŸ§ª Workflow Overview:

ðŸ§¼ Data Preprocessing
Cleaned, normalized, and augmented the dataset to enhance generalization and reduce overfitting.

ðŸ§  Model Development
Designed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) tailored for medical image classification. Hyperparameters were fine-tuned to improve diagnostic accuracy.

ðŸ“ˆ Model Training & Evaluation
Trained the model on labeled chest X-ray images (healthy vs. pneumonia) and validated performance using test data. Achieved strong results across key metrics.

ðŸ“Š Results Visualization
Used Matplotlib to visualize learning curves (accuracy, loss) and assess the modelâ€™s behavior during training.

This project illustrates my ability to handle end-to-end AI development in healthcare scenarios â€” from data processing to model evaluation.
