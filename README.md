# Pneumonia X-ray image classification

As a personal project, I leveraged my Python skills to develop an AI model to classify X-ray images. Using advanced libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras, I built and trained a neural network to identify and categorize images of healthy patients and patients with pneumonia.

### The workflow included:

- 📝 Data preprocessing: Cleaning, normalizing, and augmenting the dataset to enhance model performance and ensure robustness.
- 🧠 Model design: Implementing a convolutional neural network (CNN) using Keras, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and optimizing the architecture for medical image classification.
- 📈 Training and evaluation: Training the model on labeled datasets, evaluating accuracy, and testing its performance on unseen X-ray images.
- 📊 Result visualization: Using tools like Matplotlib to analyze metrics such as accuracy and loss, providing insights into the model’s performance.
