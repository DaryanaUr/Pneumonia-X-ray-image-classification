# X-ray-Images-Classification

As a personal project, I leveraged my Python skills to develop an AI model to classify X-ray images. Using advanced libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras, I built and trained a neural network to identify and categorize images of healthy patients and patients with pneumonia.

### The workflow included:

- 📝 Data preprocessing: Cleaning, normalizing, and augmenting the dataset to enhance model performance and ensure robustness.
- 🧠 Model design: Implementing a convolutional neural network (CNN) using Keras, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and optimizing the architecture for medical image classification.
- 📈 Training and evaluation: Training the model on labeled datasets, evaluating accuracy, and testing its performance on unseen X-ray images.
- 📊 Result visualization: Using tools like Matplotlib to analyze metrics such as accuracy, loss, and confusion matrices, providing insights into the model’s performance.

The main goal of this project was to deepen my understanding of deep learning and explore its potential in medical imaging for practical applications.
